Description:

I love Fibonacci numbers in general, but I must admit I love some more than others.

I would like for you to write me a function that when given a number (n) returns the n-th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For example:

   nthFibo(4) == 2
Because 2 is the 4th number in the Fibonacci Sequence.

For reference, the first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

--# write your SQL statement here: 
-- you are given a table 'fibo' with column 'n'.
-- return a table with:
--   this column and your result in a column named 'res'
--   ordered ascending by 'n'
--   distinct results (remove duplicates)

Solution:

with recursive cte(res,res1,n) as(
    select 0::bigint,1::bigint,1::bigint
    union all
    select res1+res::bigint,res::bigint,n+1 from cte where n<51
)
select distinct fibo.n, res::bigint from cte
join fibo using(n)
order by n
